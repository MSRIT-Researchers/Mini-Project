# "Parallel iterative query processing and progressive visualization to enhance user experience"
### A research-oriented project where we build and analyze a custom querying algorithm to enhance interactivity and speed for the end-user performing data exploration activities on an ultra-large database. In specific, we employ parallel iterative processing in such a way as to best enable progressive visualization of results. Thus, parallel iterative processing not just affords speedup, but also contributes to a better end-user experience through progressive visualization.
